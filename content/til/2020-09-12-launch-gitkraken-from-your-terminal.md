# Summary

I prefer to use [GitKraken](https://gitkraken.com/) for managing my repositories. However, it's gotten to the point where it's way too much work to open the GitKraken app, and then select my recent repository. I found a faster way to do it thought the terminal with the following command:

> `open -a 'GitKraken' --args -p $(pwd)`

Since we both already forgot that, let's create an [alias](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-bash-aliases/) so that we can open our repository in GitKraken with a single command: `kraken`. An alias is basically a custom command that runs another command. It's used when you are to ~~lazy~~ smart to type out a longer command that you use frequently.

# Usage

Create a custom alias named `kraken` by typing the following in your terminal

```bash
alias kraken="open -a 'GitKraken' --args -p $(pwd)" 
```

# Example

Once you have created the alias, navigate to your repository and run the `kraken` command.

```bash
> cd Development/my-project
> kraken
```

This should launch your repository in a new tab in GitKraken! ðŸ˜Ž

# TLDR

You can open your repository in GitKraken from your terminal's working directory with the following alias:

```bash
alias kraken="open -a 'GitKraken' --args -p $(pwd)" 
```
