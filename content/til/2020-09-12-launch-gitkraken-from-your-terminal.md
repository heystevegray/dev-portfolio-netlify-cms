# Summary

I prefer to use [GitKraken](https://gitkraken.com/) for managing my repositories. However, it's gotten to the point where it's way too much work to open the GitKraken app, and then select my recent repository. I found a faster way to do it thought the terminal with the following command:

> `open -a 'GitKraken' --args -p $PWD`

Since we both already forgot that, let's create an [alias](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-bash-aliases/) so that we can open our repository in GitKraken with a single command: `kraken`. An alias is basically a custom command that runs another command. It's used when you are to ~~lazy~~ smart to type out a longer command that you use frequently.

# Usage

## Configuration file

I am running a zsh shell on a Mac. But the default one is a bash shell.

## Terminal

Create a custom alias named `kraken` by typing the following in your terminal

```bash
alias kraken='open -na "GitKraken" --args -p $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)'
```

To list your aliases, just type the alias command

```bash
> alias
```

You can delete your alias with the `unalias` command

```bash
> unalias kraken
```

## Wait wot

$PWD, printenv what is `-p`

# Example

Once you have created the alias, navigate to your repository and run the `kraken` command.

```bash
> cd Development/my-project
> kraken
```

This should launch your repository in a new tab in GitKraken! ðŸ˜Ž

# TLDR

You can open your repository in GitKraken from your terminal's working directory with the following alias:

```bash
alias kraken='open -na "GitKraken" --args -p $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)'
```
