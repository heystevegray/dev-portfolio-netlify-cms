# Summary

I prefer to use [GitKraken](https://gitkraken.com/) for managing my repositories. However, it's gotten to the point where it's way too much work to open the GitKraken app, and then select my recent repository. I found a faster way to do it thought the terminal with the following command:

> `open -a "GitKraken" --args -p $(pwd)`

Since we both already forgot that, let's create an [alias](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-bash-aliases/) so that we can open our repository in GitKraken with a single command: `kraken`. An alias is basically a custom command that runs another command. It's used when you are to ~~lazy~~ smart to type out a longer command that you use frequently.

# Usage

## Terminal

Create a custom alias named `kraken` by typing the following in your terminal:

```bash
alias kraken='open -a "GitKraken" --args -p $(pwd)'
```

To list your aliases, just type the `alias` command:

```bash
alias
kraken='open -a "GitKraken" --args -p $(pwd)'
```

You can delete your alias with the `unalias` command:

```bash
unalias kraken
```

## Persisting aliases (configuration file)

You may notice the above method doesn't persist your alias after you close the terminal. To [persist your alias](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29853849), you need to add it to your terminal's configuration file. I'm using [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), so I will add the following line to my `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
alias kraken='open -a "GitKraken" --args -p $(pwd)'
```

For bash terminals, you can add this command to your `~/.bash_profile` (for Mac) or `~/.bashrc` files. If you are not sure what terminal you are using you can check with the following command:

```bash
echo "$SHELL"
/bin/zsh
```

# Example

Once you have created the alias, navigate to your repository and run the `kraken` command.

```bash
cd Development/my-project
kraken
```

This should launch your repository in a new tab in GitKraken! ðŸ˜Ž
