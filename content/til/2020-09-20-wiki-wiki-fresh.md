# Summary

![ooga-chaka wiki](assets/screen-shot-2020-09-20-at-7.27.28-pm.png "ooga-chaka wiki")

I am working on [a custom React Hooks library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ooga-chaka), and I wanted to be able to organize all of the [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) documentation that I was creating for it. I have seen really slick websites for documentation, like the [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), and I wanted something that was easy to maintain and navigate. I knew I would be including editing and hosting. This was made possible with [GitHub wiki pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis).

If you are not familiar with React Hooks, you can [learn more about them here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

## History

Wiki was created by [Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham), check out this awesome [interview.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ward_Cunningham,_Inventor_of_the_Wiki.webm)

> "Wiki" is a Hawaiian word that means "quick" | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ward_Cunningham,_Inventor_of_the_Wiki.webm)

## Fun facts

> The name "Wikipedia" is a blending of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning "quick") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with additional information. | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#:~:text=The%20name%20%22Wikipedia%22%20is%20a,related%20pages%20with%20additional%20information.)

\* That moment when you realize [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is just a bunch of markdown files *

# Usage

1. To get started, [add a new wilki page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages) to the wiki section of your GitHub repository.
2. Just like your git repository, you can also `clone` and [edit your wiki pages locally](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages#adding-or-editing-wiki-pages-locally) like this:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.wiki.git
   ```
3. You can spice things up and [edit the sidebar](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-footer-or-sidebar-for-your-wiki#creating-a-sidebar) and [customize your footer](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-footer-or-sidebar-for-your-wiki#creating-a-footer).
4. You can even collaborate on the wiki using different branches:

   > You and your collaborators can create branches when working on wikis, but only changes pushed to the default branch will be made live and available to your readers. | [Source](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages#adding-or-editing-wiki-pages-locally)
