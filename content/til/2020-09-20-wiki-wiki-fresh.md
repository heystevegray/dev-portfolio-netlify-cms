# Summary

![ooga-chaka wiki](assets/screen-shot-2020-09-20-at-7.27.28-pm.png "ooga-chaka wiki")

I. JUST. WANTED. TO. BE. ABLE. TO. ORGANIZE. MY. DOCS. The goal would be to make a documentation site like the [react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). But I needed an easy way to manage my documentation, which was just a collection of markdown files. This was made possible with [GitHub wiki pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis).

## History

Wiki was created by [Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham), check out this awesome [interview.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ward_Cunningham,_Inventor_of_the_Wiki.webm)

> "Wiki" is a Hawaiian word that means "quick" | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ward_Cunningham,_Inventor_of_the_Wiki.webm)

## Fun facts

> The name "Wikipedia" is a blending of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning "quick") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with additional information. | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About#:~:text=The%20name%20%22Wikipedia%22%20is%20a,related%20pages%20with%20additional%20information.)

That moment when you realize [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is just a bunch of markdown files.

# Usage

1. To get started, [add a new wilki page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages) to the wiki section of your GitHub repository.
2. Just like your git repository, you can also `clone` and [edit your wiki pages locally](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages#adding-or-editing-wiki-pages-locally) like this:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.wiki.git
   ```
3. You can spice things up and [edit the sidebar](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-footer-or-sidebar-for-your-wiki#creating-a-sidebar) and [customize your footer](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-footer-or-sidebar-for-your-wiki#creating-a-footer).
4. You can even collaborate on the wiki using different branches:

   > You and your collaborators can create branches when working on wikis, but only changes pushed to the default branch will be made live and available to your readers. | [Source](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages#adding-or-editing-wiki-pages-locally)
