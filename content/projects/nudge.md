  My friend [John Fay](https://johnfay.dev/) and I created this app as one of
  our first [Progressive Web Apps
  (PWA's)](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).
  I was sick of trying to choose between Pizza, Chipotle, Pizza, and Five Guy's
  for dinner all the time. I knew that it would be one of the same few options,
  I just didn't want to waste precious Netflix time struggling to decide which
  one to choose. Enter nudge. The app to streamline your decision making
  process! Create as many lists as you want, and have your options served to you
  using AI and Machine Learning, jk it's just random. We respect your privacy,
  all data is stored offline on your device.
